### The first day

So this is it. Our first day. 8 months of planing behind us. Who would have thought that 8  months ago when we came up with the idea that we would actually do it. These 8 months seemed to be the longest until our departure on 30 July 2022.

We started our trip taking the RE from Berlin Alexander Platz to east Berlin Erkner. Fully loaded with how I would call them ˋSUV´ bikes we left our beloved flat in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg doing our first Kilometer to Alex catching a train. Lucky us we had two lovely people (Josh a friend of Jogi and my little sister Greta) who would escort us for the first 30km to make sure our bikes did not take control of us.   
  
Our scenic route passed through the Spreewald and parts of the Gurkenradweg. We cycled through all the typical Spreewald villages tasting Spreewald Gurken, drinking a nice cold beer and just enjoying our first Kilometers of the trip. Our sleeping spot for the first night was a biwak spot with a beautiful view on the river. We had lovely self cooked vegan chilli set up the tent and went to bed early. On our very first day we managed to cycle 95km quite surprising since we haven’t cycled in a while. To sum up I am super proud of us that we already cycled so far even Jogi was sick recently. Stay tuned for some next posts …
